**Identification and Removal of Noise in Hyper-spectral Data Using Convolutional Neural Network**

The objective of my thesis is to highlight the importance of Convolutional Neural Networks (machine learning) in geophysics. So far, we rely on traditional techniques, that require expertise in software. But these software have limited access (some are useful for specific geophysical data type only), they are not suitable for very large dataset, i.e. in terabytes, and they also need every time calibration and adjustment of the data before processing. One of the main drawbacks is that we must tune or calibrate our software every time we get the new data, and we cannot apply results of first data type to other. I decided to use machine learning techniques so we do not need to calibrate every time we use different datasets, and more importantly if we build the accurate model, we can directly apply that model to the new datasets. Since I have started with the denoising of hyperspectral data, but I will keep trying to build models for the whole processing of geophysical data.
